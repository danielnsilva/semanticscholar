Two Images of Alan Turing", "abstract": "Turing made intriguing statements about the future of arti\ufb01cial intelligence (AI) in society. He predicted that machines would eventually \u2018compete with men in all purely intellectual \ufb01elds,\u2019 and added that at some stage they could be expected \u2018to take control.\u2019 Turing has been associated by his biographer, Andrew Hodges, with Dr. Frankenstein from Mary Shelley\u2019s dystopian novel. However, he has also been described by his contemporary Geoffrey Jefferson as a \u2018scienti\ufb01c\u2019 Percy B. Shelley, the English Romantic poet who was posthumously championed as a utopian and radical thinker. This article then asks: in what way did Turing envision a society permeated with intelligent machines? Did he see it as a utopia or a dystopia? These questions are thoroughly examined using Turing\u2019s own texts and related sources. This study reconstructs Turing\u2019s historical context in postwar England and analyzes his irony and sense of humor, as well as the in\ufb02uence of Samuel Butler on his vision. Contrary to recent views in AI science and \ufb01ction, on the one hand, a mismatch is shown between Turing and the incautious Frankenstein; on the other hand, Turing\u2019s radical Shelley-like qualities are substantiated. The article shows that Turing\u2019s utopianism entrusted intelligent machines with the task of teaching lessons of rationality and intellectual integrity over our place in nature and prejudices. Further, Turing\u2019s irony is shown to have targeted intellectuals who sacri\ufb01ce independent thinking to retain their power. These, he hoped, would be eventually rivaled and surpassed by intelligent machines.", "venue": "", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 60, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Art", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262347", "name": "A.

Eleven essays deal directly with codebreaking. Copeland either wrote, participated in the writing of, or revised 16 of the essays. Of the eight essays in the section \u201cArtificial Intelligence and the Mind,\u201d three were written by Diane Proudfoot and one includes her as a coauthor with Copeland (who wrote one other essay and coauthored a third essay in that section). The book begins with an overview of Turing\u2019s life and work by Copeland and Bowen. The essay is mostly a timeline of Turing\u2019s life. The authors suggest that Turing\u2019s death might have been accidental. Chapter 3, \u201cMeeting a Genius\u201d (4 pages), is by mathematician and Bletchley Park codebreaker Peter Hilton (1923\u20132010).

The intention of this article is to present a broader approach to Alan Turing instead of solely focusing on the above mentioned key words. Alan Turing was not only a key figure in computer science and crypto-analysis. His work also revolved around subjects such as the growth of plants, the human mind and he also anticipated many of the issues that are being discussed in today\u2019s artificial intelligence research. Being unconventional, ahead of his time as a visionary and openly admitting his homosexuality caused a lot personal problems during his life. However Alan Turing was successfully able to balance his life by relying on personal friends, scientific colleagues, his work and sports. He became a tragic icon when he died at age 42 apparently having committed suicide. 1 Family background and childhood: Alan Mathison Turing was born in London on 23 June 1912. His parents Julius Mathison and Ethel Sara Turing had met in India where Julius worked in the Indian Civil Service. Ethel Sara was the daughter of a chief engineer working for Madras railways. Alan also had an older brother named John. The two boys spent most of their childhood with a variety of foster parents as Julius and Ethel soon moved back to India after Alan\u2019s birth. His childhood was mainly influenced by his family situation and his family\u2019s upper-middle-class status inside the English society at the beginning of the 20th century. There was little incentive for scientific exploration in the family or school at the time so Alan\u2019s first contact with science occurred during his free time. One of the books which he read during his childhood was called \u201dNatural Wonders Every Child Should Know\u201d \u2217e-mail: e0425826@student.tuwien.ac.at", "venue": "100 Years of Math Milestones", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 125, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Art", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": "2019-06-12", "journal": {"name": "100 Years of Math Milestones"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262347", "name": "A.

The network is self-organized by \"learning without a teacher\", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname \"neocognitron\". After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consists of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of \"S-cells', which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of \"C-cells\" similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any \"teacher\" during the process of selforganization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cells of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Biology", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": null, "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1708655", "name": "B.

Year 2012 is both the centenary of Alan Turing's birth and the 60th anniversary of the famous paper The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, in which he established foundations of the mathematical theory of biological and chemical pattern formation. The story started much earlier, in spring 1923, as documented by his mother in a caricature entitled Hockey or Watching the Daisies Grow. Crucial motif in the drawing is that, while most players are engaged by the game, Alan is investigating a flower emerging just off the field. Always fascinated by the relationship between matter and spirit, especially in the processes of thinking , Turing started from the assumption that the operation of human brain is completely physical. This led him to invention of an abstract computing machine named after him, which laid the foundations of modern computer science. In recognition of his enormous contribution to the growth of the field, the most prestigious award in computer science, called \" Nobel Prize of computing \" , is named after Turing. Success has many fathers, but it was Alan Turing to whom we owe the final breaking of the Enigma code. He extended the idea of so-called \" Cryptology bombs \" , i.e., machines aimed at breaking codes, constructed before World War II by Polish mathematicians: Rejewski, R\u00f3\u02d9 zycki and Zygalski. His solution ensured the information advantage of the Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic, which had a direct bearing on the success of operations in Normandy and the defeat of Nazi Germany. After the war, Turing took up marathon running to relieve the stress, studied why spots on the leop-ard's body are in the shape of a rosette or ring, and proposed a test to measure the machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. For this last reason, Turing is regarded as a founder of artificial intelligence. He left this world prematurely in the age of 42, but managed to finish the race with the highest score, in fact more than one race.. . In this special issue, we present a selection of papers commemorating Alan Turing and arguing that he should be also considered the co-founder of biomathematics and bioinformatics.

Part 1", "abstract": "In 1950, Alan M. Turing, the late deputy director of the University of Manchester\u2019s Computing Laboratory in England, proposed a novel test to determine whether a machine was capable of thinking. In thk test, an interrogator has a teletype conversation with a man and a woman, both of whom must try to convince the interrogator that they are the woman. At some point unknown to the interrogator, the man is replaced by a machine. If the interrogator is fooled as often by the machine as by the man, that machine can be said to have displayed intelligent behavior. 1 Some 30 years after Turing proposed this test, many aspects of human behavior have been simulated by a computer. Programs have been designed to play checkersz and chess,J prove mathematical theorems ,4,5 and even mimic the behavior of a paranoid human being.b Despite the success of these and many other programs, none of the researchers investigating what\u2019s been variously cafled \u201capplied epistemology\u201d or \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d (AI) would claim this means the \u201cthinking machine\u201d has arrived. Instead, they would agree that these programs have contributed important information about human behavior, and how computers can simulate it. The first part of this two-part essay will review some of the theones AI researchers have developed to explain human \u201cinformation processing.\u201d The second part of the essay will cover some applications of AI research. These include programs used in robotics, programs that communicate with computer users in natural languages such as English, and \u201cexpert systems\u201d which help chemists, physicians, and others perform decision-making tasks. The \u201cpioneer\u201d expert system, DENDRAL, will be discussed in some detail.T.~ AI grew out of the convergence of ideas in several different fields, and the availability of new technologies. According to Avrom Barr and Edward A. Feigenbaum, Stanford University, California, the single most important factor contributing to the birth of the field was the invention of the computer.9 They point out that human beings have always drawn analogies between mechanical devices and their own behavior. Computers, with their memories and information-processing abilities, naturafly invited analogies with the human brain. Shortly after digital computers became available, computer scientists began creating programs that, they hoped, would perform tasks generally considered to require intelligence. Their earliest efforts were directed at programming computers to solve puzzles, play games such as chess, backgammon, and checkers, solve mathematical theorems, and translate text from one language to another. The early computer programs performed these tasks, but not very well. For example, chess programs were successful at following the step-by-step instructions for moving chessmen.

There is a modified form of \u03bb-definability, known as \u03bb-K-definability, and it turns out to be natural to put the proof that every \u03bb-definable function is computable in the form of a proof that every \u03bb-K-definable function is computable; that every \u03bb-definable function is \u03bb-K-definable is trivial. If these results are taken in conjunction with an already available proof that every general recursive function is \u03bb-definable we shall have the required equivalence of computability with \u03bb-definability and incidentally a new proof of the equivalence of \u03bb-definability and \u03bb-K-definability. A definition of what is meant by a computable function cannot be given satisfactorily in a short space. I therefore refer the reader to Computable pp. 230\u2013235 and p. 254. The proof that computability implies recursiveness requires no more knowledge of computable functions than the ideas underlying the definition: the technical details are recalled in \u00a75.", "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Logic (JSL)", "year": 1937, "referenceCount": 6, "citationCount": 386, "influentialCitationCount": 38, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Computer Science", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "external"}, {"category": "Computer Science", "source": "s2-fos-model"}, {"category": "Mathematics", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["JournalArticle"], "publicationDate": "1937-12-01", "journal": {"volume": "2", "pages": "153 - 163", "name": "Journal of Symbolic Logic"}, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262347", "name": "A.

If the meaning of the words \"machine\" and \"think\" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, \"Can machines think?\" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The new form of the problem can be described in terms of a game which we call the \"imitation game.\" It is played with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The interrogator stays in a room apart' from the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at the end of the game he says either \"X is A and Y is B\" or \"X is Band Y is A.\" The interrogator is allowed to put questions to A and B thus: C: Will X please tell me the length of his or her hair? Now suppose X is actually A, then A must answer. It is A's object in the game to try and cause C to make the wrong identification. His answer might therefore be: \"My hair is shingled, and the longest strands are about nine inches long. \" 11", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "influentialCitationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": null, "fieldsOfStudy": null, "s2FieldsOfStudy": [{"category": "Philosophy", "source": "s2-fos-model"}], "publicationTypes": ["Review"], "publicationDate": null, "journal": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "2262347", "name": "A.
